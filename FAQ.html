Other benefits experienced through Colonics include the elimination of headaches, some types of lower back pain, easing of allergies, asthma, menstrual pain, and acne and other skin problems.

Many people take numerous supplements, try quick-fix programs or make wild dietary changes in an effort to rejuvenate their system. Unfortunately, when the body is already overwhelmed it cannot absorb nutrients properly nor can it easily release old toxins readily due to the congestion. Once the system is clearer, supplements can be used much more readily by the body. It is also much easier to switch to a more suitable diet, and shift toxins out from other areas in the body.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>We use our colon everyday and we need to care for and maintain it like we care for other parts of our body.

During a Colonic the entire colon is gently flushed with purified water so that the whole colon is cleansed in this process. The water used in an enema spends time in the Rectum and sigmoid colon only, not reaching and focusing on the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. A properly delivered Colonic helps to tone and stimulate the intestinal walls, leading to better functioning of the colon while an enema helps with immediate relief.</p></div>

Please avoid coffee, caffeine, sugar and alcohol for the entire day, as these are very hard on the system, and disrupt the body's natural rejuvenation process. It is better not to eat, or drink anything except water for 2-3 hours before the Colonic. Please note that while you can drink water before your session, you do not need to drink extra water during the 2-3 hours before the session as this may result in the need to stop the session for the client to visit the washroom to urinate. Following these suggestions will optimize your results because the body makes digestion a priority over elimination. It also helps to drink lots of water the day before your appointment. &nbsp;</p></div>

The Colonic Hydrotherapist will explain what is happening throughout the session, and you are welcome to ask quetions. After turning onto your side, a single-use disposalbe proctoscope is inserted into your rectum. Only about one and a half-inches of the instrument is placed in your body. Next two tubes are attached to the section of the proctoscope on the outside of your body to create an enclosed system. One tube carries water into the large intestine and the other tube carries the water and unwanted debris out of the body. Purified water is gently flushed in and out of the colon. During the session the Colon Therapist will use different techniques to assist the body's process. For example, they may incorporate abdominal massage to stimulate the release of toxins and better understand the health of your colon. A trained Colon Hydrotherapist is with you throughout the entire procedure and you are welcome to ask questions at any point. At the end of the session you go into a private washroom directly attached to the room to redress</p></div>

The average person will benefit from a series of regular colonics over a period of a few weeks. Someone with a more serious problem such as lifelong constipation will likely benefit from a more extended program combined with diet and lifestyle changes to find more permanent relief.</p><p><br></p><p>Our experience with Colonic Hydrotherapy at The Yellow Brick Road is that while there are some similar patterns that occur, everyone’s needs and goals are different. Your Colonic Hydrotherapist can provide feedback to help you develop your own personal program and assess how many Colonics you should have.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Our Colon Therapists are experienced Holistic Practitioners. They will help you with other lifestyle issues such as diet and exercise, as well as providing referrals to other therapeutic modalities.

Colonics are a great preparation and support for other cleanses such as a liver or kidney detox. Having a Colonic can flush out toxins released from deeper in the body that may still be sitting in your colon. This will prevent them from being reabsorbed by the body and often assists with 'detox symptoms'. Our Colon Therapists are very knowledgeable about a wide variety of detox programs.</p></div>

Your Doctor will prescribe specific preparations for this procedure. Some people are able to use 2-3 sessions of Colonic Hydrotherapy as a part of this preparation process as it is both a gentle and effective way to cleanse the colon.
