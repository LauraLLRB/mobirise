                        <div class="card-block">If you are trying to improve your health and energy level, cleansing your body is the first step. Many people take numerous supplements, try quick-fix programs or make wild dietary changes in an effort to rejuvenate their system. Unfortunately, when the body is already overwhelmed it cannot absorb nutrients properly nor can it easily release old toxins readily due to the congestion. Once the system is clearer, supplements can be used much more readily by the body. It is also much easier to switch to a more suitable diet, and shift toxins out from other areas in the body.<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 2;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 2;">We use our colon everyday and we need to care for and maintain it like we care for other parts of our body.

Only about one and a half-inches of the instrument is placed in your body.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 2;">Next two tubes are attached to the section of the proctoscope on the outside of your body to create an enclosed system.  One tube carries water into the large intestine and the other tube carries the water and unwanted debris out of the body.  Purified water is gently flushed in and out of the colon. During the session the Colon Therapist will use different techniques to assist the body's process.  For example, they may incorporate abdominal massage to stimulate the release of toxins and better understand the health of your colon.  A Certified Colon Therapist is with you throughout the entire procedure and you are welcome to ask questions at any point. At the end of the session you go into a private washroom directly attached to the room to redress.</span></p></div>

A properly delivered Colonic helps to tone and stimulate the intestinal walls, leading to better functioning of the colon while an enema helps with immediate relief.</p></div>

Colonics are a great preparation and support for other cleanses such as a liver or kidney detox.  Having a Colonic can flush out toxins released from deeper in the body that may still be sitting in your colon.  This will prevent them from being reabsorbed by the body and often assists with 'detox symptoms'.  Our Colon Therapists are very knowledgeable about a wide variety of detox programs.</p></div>

This examination can help detect inflamed tissue, ulcers, polyps and abnormal growths.  For accurate results, the colon walls should be as free of debris as possible.  Your Doctor will prescribe specific preparations for this procedure.  Some people are able to use 2-3 sessions of Colonic Hydrotherapy as a part of this preparation process as it is both a gentle and effective way to cleanse the colon.

Please avoid coffee, caffeine, sugar and alcohol for the entire day, as these are very hard on the system, and disrupt the body's natural rejuvenation process.  It is better not to eat, or drink anything except water for 2-3 hours before the Colonic. Please note that while you can drink water before your session, you do not need to drink extra water during the 2-3 hours before the session as this may result in the need to stop the session for the client to visit the washroom to urinate. Following these suggestions will optimize your results because the body makes digestion a priority over elimination.  It also helps to drink lots of water the day before your appointment. &nbsp;</p></div>

                        <div class="card-block"><p>A completely <strong>optional</strong> mixture of Psyllium and Bentonite Clay can be taken several days before your treatment to break-up and release old debris.  Mix 1 tablespoon of each in 8 oz. water, stir and drink once a day.  Make sure you are drinking at least 8 glasses of water per day if you are taking this mixture.  Both Psyllium and Bentonite can be found at many health food stores.  You can also wait until after your first appointment to assess how you feel and speak with the Therapist about any suggestions. If you are doing a specific preparation, it is also recommended to book your appointment in advance to ensure we are able to accomodate a convenient time.</p></div>

For example, you may choose to avoid fried or processed foods and red meat, as well as common allergens such as wheat and dairy. Please avoid coffee, caffeine, alcohol and sugar foods for the whole day. It is also good to avoid any foods that you know irritate your system. If you wish to eat straight after treatment, fresh vegetable juice or soup is ideal.&nbsp;</p></div>

This gives us an opportunity to offer the time to other clients who may need it. Please call rather than email if you are cancelling with less than 24 hours notice so that we are sure to hear the message as soon as possible as it may be outside of reception hours. If we are assisting other clients, please leave a message. The answering machine will log the time you called so you will not be penalized if you do not reach us directly when giving 24 hours notice. </p><p>The fee for late cancellations is half the regular appointment cost. Many businesses charge the full amount. We absorb the other half lost from the missed appointment as we may not be able to fill the appointment without 24 hours notice. If two late cancellations occur consecutively, we request that the fees be paid in advance of your next booking. This can be done in person or by providing your credit card number over the phone. Your credit card information will be destroyed immediately after use unless we have been given permission to store it.&nbsp;</p></div>

We book sessions back-to-back and do our best to start on time so that our clients can better arrange their day and commitments. Lateness of 15 minutes or more may mean that there is not enough time to conduct your session. A late cancellation fee of half the appointment cost will apply.&nbsp;</p></div>
